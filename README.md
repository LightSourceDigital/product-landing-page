(or use VS Code Live Server)

## Certification
This project fulfills the **Product Landing Page** requirement for the **freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification**.

## freeCodeCamp Testing Note

This repository represents the **portfolio version** of the project.

- The logo image (`white_halo.png`) is stored locally so it displays correctly on GitHub and GitHub Pages.
- freeCodeCamp tests require the `#header-img` `src` attribute to be a **valid hosted URL**.

If you need to re-run the freeCodeCamp tests, temporarily replace the image source with a hosted image, for example:

```html
<img
  id="header-img"
  src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Logo_placeholder.svg"
  alt="HaloDesk logo"
/>
